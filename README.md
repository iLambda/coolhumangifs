# coolhumangifs
A client webpage which turns mathematical expression trees to artsy animated GIFs.

The site is live at [ilambda.io/coolhumangifs](http://ilambda.io/coolhumangifs). The code is not ready yet to be shared here, as it is pretty dirty and needs a rewrite.
In the meantime, you can check [iLambda/coolbotgifs](https://github.com/iLambda/coolbotgifs), which does pretty much the same as coolhumangifs, only that it's a bot that generates the GIFs.

To be notified when the code is here, watch this repository, or even better, [follow me on GitHub](https://github.com/iLambda).
